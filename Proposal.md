# Project Proposal

## The Big Idea
- a tool to submit plans of study
- simplify approval process
- student-facing, registrar-facing, advisor-facing
- simplify interface for filing requirements
- make it pretty to get the ball rolling

## MVP
- Solely student-facing
- Course Database
- Plan-of-study creation
- Plan-of-study export to advisor/registrar
- Plan-of-study and major requirements tracking
- Taken course input
- Looks professional

## Stretch Goals
- Revise plan-of-study
- Registrar-facing side
- Advisor-facing side (approval process)

## Learning Goals

Robbie:
- All be friends at the end
- Teamwork on a software project
- Better understand scoping of a large project
- Design + CSS stuff
- Be proud of finished product
- Understand communication between and back ends

Logan:
- Ship a finished project
- Sensible file structure
- Top-to-bottom understanding
- Have a good boilerplate

Ariana:
- Learn good git practices on a team
- More practice with / improve React skills
- Professional code with nice documentation

Taylor:
- Use the project to fill in holes in everybody’s understanding
- Make an app I’d be happy to ship (good architecture, fast, nice UI, something I’d use)
- Git good
- Understanding what webpack is doing (making a boilerplate I’m happy with in the process)

Jeremy:
- Get better at React
- Use good git practices
- Make a quality final deliverable

## Basic pages
- Login Page
- Student Home
- Create Plan-Of-Study
- Input Courses Taken

## Schedule checkpoints
Sprint 1:
- Login Page
  - Define User schema (taken courses, major)
    - Assume major is a string “MechE”
    - Assume taken ModSim, ISIM, and DesNat
    - Assume everyone is a MechE
  - Define Course Schema
- Student Home
  - Define Major Schema
  - Navigation Bar
  - Home page
    - Present Current Plan-Of-Study
  - My account page with some settings

## Risks
- Going too far on one implementation
- Figuring out kinks in Jira/PM workflow
- Underestimate how complicated the major requirements schema will be
