# register
A web app for simplifying the entire registration process. Done as a final project for Olin.js Spring 2017.

## To Run:
1) Clone this repository and navigate into it.
1) Run `npm install` to install packages.
1) Run `npm run build` to build the frontend bundled code from webpack.
1) Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to run the backend server locally.
1) In your browser, go to localhost:3000/ to see the web app.

The backend is run using nodemon, which should restart the server automatically when code changes as long as npm start is running. Similarly, the frontend is bundled using webpack, which should restart the server automatically as long as npm run build is running. Manually restart any of these commands if problems don't update correctly.
